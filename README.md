## Insurance Cross-Selling Prediction
This repository contains a supervised machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a customer with a health insurance policy will also purchase a car insurance policy (cross-selling).

## Project Overview
The goal is to develop a binary classification model to support a fictional insurance company in identifying customers likely to respond positively to a car insurance offer. The analysis includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing

Feature encoding and scaling

Class balancing strategies

Model training and evaluation

Comparison between models

## Models Used
Two main classifiers were developed and compared:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Additional models (e.g., Random Forest) were studied during experimentation but not included in the final notebook.
